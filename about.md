Welcome to my page!  I'm a software developer and information technology professional based in New York City.  I have worked with big, small and non-profit organizations.  

I am an alum of [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) and before that I studied Computer Information Systems at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/).  

I currently enjoy building useful applications through my company [Codigo NYC](http://codigonyc.com/).
