Hi!  Appears you have stumbled onto my homepage.  I'm a software developer and information technology consultant based in New York City.  I have consulted for big, small and non-profit organizations.  I am an alum of [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) and before that I studied Computer Information Systems at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/).  I accept consulting engagements worldwide through my company [Codigo NYC](http://codigonyc.com/).
