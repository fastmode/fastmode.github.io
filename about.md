I have worked in the Information Technology for over a decade and have dived deep into web development for the last couple of years.  I enjoy programming in Javascript and Rails.  Recent Javascript libraries I enjoy are React and D3.  

This site is documentation of my discoveries and thoughts on technology and web development.

Here are some projects I currently iterate on:

**Espera** - view border wait times from Canadian and Mexican port of entries.  
[Live App](http://www.espers.io) | [GitHub](https://github.com/fastmode/espera-app)

**Rails Issue Tracker** - keep track of your work with tickets and issues.
