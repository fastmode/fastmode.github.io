My name is Art Rodriguez.  I have worked in the Information Technology for over a decade.  I recently decided to change careers into the web development world.  

This blog is my documentation of my journey into this world.  I am attending Flatiron School to complete their Full Stack Web Development program.  

Here are some projects I have recently completed working on:
