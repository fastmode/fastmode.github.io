Ever since I got my hands on my very first computer I wanted to know how it worked and how it made things happened.  I was fascinated by how my input could drive things to happen and it would tell hardware to follow processes.  I grew up building, fixing, and upgrading computers.  I pretty much stayed on the hardware and systems side for most of my life.  I went to college and started a career in Information Technology focusing primarly on server, networking, and operations side of the industry.  Here and there I would pick up a few bit of knowledge and skill set on coding, but I never really dove in.  I picked up HTML, a bit of CSS, and some php in order to get some simple sites up, but as time went by I never really dug into this to take myself to the next level.  I learned Java, C++, Python as well, but with no real world application at my work, these skills were never really practiced and those concepts and knowledge were forgotten.  

I finally decided I needed to be serious about it and signed up with Flatiron.  I am now looking forward to developing existing skills and picking up a ton more.  I am fascinated with what can be done but first one has to truly learn how to speak and use the language.  To answer the main question of this post, I really want to learn software development so that I can build things.  I want to create things.  I hope in the near future I can add something to this awesome space.
